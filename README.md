<h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify">Random numbers can be generated by a computer, but these are pseudorandom, this because of the hardware components, which does not allow them to be pure random numbers, and what matters to us is to have a more random number possible, because when more random is the most unpredictable number it is. but try to think about it, if we add random numbers, will the result be more random? this is the meaning of this repo, to resolve this issue. The code upstairs already has the answer, but here is a brief explanation of the answer.
